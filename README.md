# Tweeter Project
Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone using HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX in the front end side of things and focusing on Node and Express in the back-end.

## Final Product
Here are some examples of what "Tweeter" looks like to the user when they want to share their thoughts or scroll through their friends thoughts. When a user presses "Tweet" their new tweet appears on the app, ordered with newest and the top and oldest at the bottom!
